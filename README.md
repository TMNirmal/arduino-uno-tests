# Arduino Uno Tests

A collection of **basic Arduino Uno projects** focused on testing fundamental coding techniques and interfacing with peripherals such as LEDs, displays, and communication modules.  
All projects are developed using **PlatformIO** in **VS Code** with pure C++ (`.cpp`) structure (no `.ino` files).
